## Description

This project was to help people creat all sorts of strong passwords for anyones who is in need to have them. This was to help anyone who wanted to have a creative and different password for any need they would want. This solves or creats someones password from being a weak one that can be hack into easy. To a strong one that pretect there accounts. In this project I have learned how to link html, css, and javaScript and creat multiple function to work together to creat a random string for a password.
